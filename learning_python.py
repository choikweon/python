"""
I have read the book and learned something I did not know
The author seems to be a 'true believer' of python
The book taught me to write code clean and python-like
The book was not a python tutorial, but more like a guidebook for a junior
developer with experience with other programming language, or for someone already
using python but looking for a better way to organize the code
I will have to read the book whenever I need to look back into the skills I have read
Meaning that, I did not really went through the book. I actually skipped many parts.
But I do appriciate this book as a good teacher and I am sure that the book will be
a good friend as I start working with python.
But for now, that I have some experience with python,
